* Main results
I’ve been involved in fusion plasma science since my M.Sci. thesis in Physics in 1999. During these 13 years
I’ve tried to expand as much as possible my personal research skills focusing in particular on collection,
analysis, interpretation and modeling of experimental data collected in fusion oriented experiments
(Reversed Field Pinches, Tokamaks and Stellarators), with particular emphasis on the comparison with theoretical and numerical results.
Main research subjects may be summarized as follow:

 1. Electromagnetic turbulence induced transport:, with emphasis on anomalous transport studies induced by different source of turbulence:
 electrostatic as Drift-induced or interchange induced transport, or electromagnetic including the
 role of magnetic flutter fluuxes in the mechanism of particle and energy losses
 2. Statistical analysis of plasma turbulence: the topic allowed me to get confident with advanced statistical tool (as Wavelet Transforms, Local Intermittency Measurements, Waiting Time distribution) and with dynamical system model as Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) systems, shell-models Blobs and ELM filaments: non linear coherent structures arising as a non-linear evolution of plasma instabilities have been experimentally investigated. The research includes studies on the generation and evolution of these structures including their parallel dynamics with emphasis on turbulent blobs and ELM fillaments
 3. Sheared flow generation and non linear interaction between turbulence and sheared flows including experimental investigation of the role of Maxwell and Reynolds stress in the momentum generation of edge flow of Reversed Field Pinch
 4. Magnetic topology and its relation with plasma flow, with emphasis on the effect of non-axysimmetric magnetic field perturbation on kinetic properties of the plasma, as plasma flow, ambipolar electric field and Plasma Wall Interaction

Among the results the following should be highlighted:
1. First experimental proof of non applicability of Self Organized Criticality paradigm to edge plasma turbulence [PRL 2001, PRL2011]
2. First experimental evidence of non-linear generation of edge 􏰆flow in Reversed Field Pinches through Reynolds stress mechanism [PRL 2005]
3. First experimental measurements of parallel current associated to coherent structures in a fusion relevant plasma [PRL2009]
4. First experimental evidence of the existence of a particular class of coherent structure, named Drift-Kinetic Alfvén vortices, arising because of the non linear coupling of Drift and Kinetic Alfvén waves in a laboratory plasma [Nuclear Fusion 2010]. This type of structure has been previously detected in the magneto- sphere
5. First experimental estimate of parallel current associated to Edge Localized Modes filament [PRL 2011]
6. First experimental measurements of 2D current distribution associated to plasma blobs [PRL 2011]
7. Experimental evidence of transition towards helical states in high current Reversed Field Pinch
operation [Nature Physics 2009]
In all my carrier I’ve always tried to conjugate a strong experimental insight on the data collection, participating in all the experimental activities mandatory in order to obtain useful experimental results, and a rigorous theoretical approach in the data analysis and interpretation, using theories and numerical tools as a frame- work to understand real plasma signals. is approach helped me to build a bridge between theories and experiments, a necessary effort in order to understand complex plasma dynamics.
