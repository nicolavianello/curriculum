electromagnetic structures in two different devices: RFX-mod Reversed
Field Pinch experiment, characterized by the presence of
Drift-Alfv\'en filaments, and ASDEX-Upgrade tokamak, with emphasis on
type I ELM's filaments \\
2011 & Supervisor for Bachelor Thesis in Physics, University of Padova \\
 & \textbf{Candidate:} Alberto Mazzi \\
 & \textbf{Thesis title:} \emph{Experimental evaluation of toroidal
   velocity distribution in the edge region of RFX-mod and its impact
   on high density regimes } \\
