\begin{cvblock}{Motivation}
\end{cvblock}
I'm a physicists with \FPtrunc\mydegree{\mydegree}{0}\mydegree\ years
experience on plasma physics, with primary focus on fusion science, but with a
broad range of interests from solar to atomic physics and low
temperature plasmas. As a Deputy Task Force leader of the largest Work
Package of EUROfusion Fusion Science department, I've proven capabilities of managing large
international scientific program, which span from high-level objectives and
priority definition, to public and private stake-holders interactions 
up to day-to-day operational decision.
The present historical period, with revamped interest on plasma and 
fusion science in particular, represents a unique opportunity to take
advantage of the large spectrum of expertise existing in within the Institute of Plasma Science
and Technology (ISTP). An inclusive approach, with a synergical and coordinated interaction of
the different spirits
constituting this research institute, could foster and
strengthen the role that the ISTP will play in future national and
international endeavors. Large research infrastructures which will come
into operation in the near future as RFX-mod2 or DTT,  as well as
participation to international fusion and non fusion programs
represent the natural framework where ISTP can play a leading role,
attracting both public and private investments,  and
where each of the peculiarities constituting the institute can find the
proper allocation and scientific relevance. I believe that the strength
of my scientific background as well as my experience in designing and
managing large international scientific program can provide me with
the capabilities for a challenging position as being the director of the ISTP.
