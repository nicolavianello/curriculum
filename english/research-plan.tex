\section*{Fluctuations in the preparation to burning plasma}
Plasmas, and in particular Fusion plasmas represent a complex system
where many interacting degrees of freedom coexist determining a
variety of non-linear behavior spreading over a broad range of
spatio-temporal scales
\cite{Kadomtsev:1992us,Sornette:2006dt}. It is known since a lot of
time that simplified diffusion paradigm can't correctly describe the
transport of energy, particles and momentum and a different
description of this dynamical system, generally found close to
marginal stability needs to be used. Proper description of plasma
dynamics require consequently to disentangle the role played by
fluctuations, which are found to emerge at all spatial and temporal
scales. My personal research activity has been indeed devoted to the analysis,
interpretation and modeling of experimental and numerical results
obtained in magnetized plasmas, with emphasis
on magnetically confined ones. More in details I've focused my effort
on electromagnetic fluctuations induced transport of energy, particle
and momentum, with interpretation in the wider framework of turbulence
theory. During my research activity I have collected a large
experience on electromagnetic transport analysis, working on different
magnetic configurations, from Reversed Field Pinches (working on
RFX-mod operating in Padova, Extrap-T2R operating in Stockholm and
TPE-1RM20 which was in operation in Japan), stellarators (with
experimental activity on TJ-II heliac type operating in Spain) and Tokamaks
(ASDEX-Upgrade and JET), and low temperature plasmas as the Simple
Magnetized Torus experiment TORPEX at EPFL. 

I've started working on fluctuation during my M.Sci. thesis, by
studying the effect of externally modified $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$
flow on turbulence and transport in the RFX-mod Reversed Field Pinch
\cite{Antoni:2000p3587}, observing transport quenching caused by
phase decoupling between fluctuations not homogeneous in the
$k_{\perp}$ spectra. The necessity of a multi-scale approach lead me to deepen my
interest in turbulence and dynamical system. It is know since
pioneering work of Kolmogorov \cite{Frisch:1996ue} that a proper
description of a non-deterministic process is based on a statistical
approach.  The Kolmogorov hypothesis is strongly based on the
assumption of self-similarity, but plasma turbulence, as well as turbulence observations from hydrodynamic to
astrophysics till econophysics \cite{Sornette:2006dt}, has been proved
to exhibit an high degree of \emph{intermittency}. This has been
clearly proved in variety of experiment
\cite{Antoni:2001p662,Vianello:2002p3579}, and has been successfully compared
with solar wind and atmospheric turbulence data
\cite{Carbone:2002p2809}, providing me a wider comprehension of the
mechanism and advanced investigation tools used also in other research
field. Stimulated from the observation of this strong intermittent
character I've been focused my effort in the characterization and
comprehension of those strong fluctuations (localized both in time and
$k_{\perp}$ spectra) responsible for the departure of self-similarity
and the multifractal nature of plasma turbulence
\cite{Bohr:1998fn}. These eddies have been characterized in a variety
of different devices and magnetic configuration
\cite{Spolaore:2009p4115,Vianello:2010p4670,Furno:2011cs,Spolaore:2015ij},
they are localized pressure perturbation with a vortex-like pattern in
the plane perpendicular to the guiding field \cite{Antoni:2006p3585},
extended along the direction of the guiding magnetic field (indeed
they are also dubbed as \emph{filaments})
and with an associated parallel current
\cite{Spolaore:2009p4115,Vianello:2010p4670}. These eddies form as a
result of non-linear evolution of plasma instabilities, and among
various one of the possible mechanism has been identified as a result
of the coupling between Drift Waves (DW) and Kinetic Alfv{\'e}n Waves
(KAW) \cite{Vianello:2010p4670}, in analogy with what observed in the
magnetosphere \cite{Martines:2009p4483,Sundkvist:2005is}. Extending
the analogy to the astrophysical plasmas, a striking similarities
between the enhancement of convective transport caused by these
filaments (depending on the parallel closure along the field line) and
the modification of the density gradient of the equatorial iogenic
plasma torus in the Jovian magnetosphere \cite{Frank:2002eu} has been
observed \cite{carralero:prl2015}. This testify that investigation on
plasma fluctuations as observed in fusion plasmas have actually a
larger impact and deep analogy with other disciplines. 
Expertise in
current filaments studies has been extended to the studies of Edge
Localized Modes (ELM)
filaments providing for the first time an experimental direct estimation of the
current density associated to a type-I filament
\cite{PhysRevLett.106.125002,Naulin:2011im,Muller:2011kj,Spolaore:2015tk}.

Multi-scale dynamics has been involved also in the process of
turbulent generated flow. It is indeed well known that Turbulence, and
in particular DWT can spontaneously generate patterns [zonal flows and
currents/fields, generally zonal structures (ZS)] 
on scales that are typically larger than the perpendicular (w.r.t. the
equilibrium magnetic field $B_0$) 
wavelength of the underlying fluctuations, $\lambda_{\perp}$, but
still shorter than the equilibrium nonuniformity scale length
\cite{Hasegawa:1979cp}. 
The emergence of this sheared ZF arises due spatial anisotropy of
fluctuation coupling, through a mechanism known in the fluid
turbulence literature as the turbulent Reynolds stress
\cite{Tynan:2009p4426}. This process, which can be interpreted also as a
non-linear energy transfer process, has been intensively studied
\cite{Vianello:2005p1976,Vianello:2006p1149} and is recently been
considered to explain the bifurcation to enanched confinement regimes
(H-modes) in tokamaks \cite{Schmitz:2012hwa}. 

Apart from the aforementioned multi-scale process regarding turbulence
and flow, which has been the primary subject of my research so far,
other complex dynamical processes connected with the presence of non-thermal
energetic particles (EP) are presently under consideration by the
scientific community. This is motivated
by the fact that EPs are expected to dominate the power balance in
future burning fusion plasmas \cite{Zonca:2015hs} and by the necessity
to correctly predict current profile redistribution due to the
injection of Neutral Beams in future devices like ITER> 

The interaction between fast ion and background turbulence have to be
considered from a dual perspective. 
From one side the role of background fluctuations on the
redistribution of fast ion has to be addressed. From the theoretical
point of view as a first approximation fast ions should not be
affected by small scale fluctuations due to their large gyroradius
through a process know as \emph{orbit averaging}. Recent numerical and
theoretical observation \cite{Albergante:2011bj} actually revealed
that the influence of electrostatic turbulence on fast ion depends on the ratio
$E/T_e$ basically,  and in some case can be considered as one of the causes of
the observed experimental observation of fast broadening of current profile after
off-axis injection of Neutral Beam
\cite{Heidbrink:2009wv,Baranov:2009p4033}. Indeed concerns for
foreseen scenario of off-axis N-NBI injection on ITER at lower power
has arisen \cite{Albergante:2011bj}. On the other hand Energetic
particles can provide the free energy source for Shear Alfv{\'e}n
Waves (SAW) and drift-Alfv{\'e}n waves (DAW) excitation on the micro and
meso-scales \cite{Zonca:2015hs} with the inclusion of even shorter
wavelength through a process of mode conversion of SAW/DAW to kinetic
Alfv{\'e}n waves. All of these instabilities could generate Zonal-like
structures at intermediate scales which interact with the original
fluctuations in a complex cross-scale self-regulated process. On the
other hand Energetic Particle induced Zonal Structure, as those for
example of the Energetic Particle Geodesic Acoustic Modes (EGAMS)
\cite{Zarzoso:2013kw,Nazikian:2008hk,Ido:2011gy} have a complicated
interaction with turbulent eddies induced by thermal ion
instabilities: this interaction could provide enhance plasma transport
and it is thus obvious that in view of burning plasmas with a
substantial fraction of energetic particles these mechanism should be
addressed. A variety of questions remain presently among the others:
\begin{description}
\item[(i)] How fast particle density is modified in presence of
  different type of fluctuations? Thus by modifying from electron to
  ion dominated turbulence is anomalous fast particle transport different?
\item[(ii)] Which is the role of magnetic fluctuations in determining
  the fast-particle current redistribution?
\item[(iii)] How shaping and \emph{exotic} configuration as negative
  triangularity affect the fast-particle distribution?
\item[(iv)] Is that possible to experimentally investigate the
  cross-scale coupling between EP-driven ZF and DWT ZF?
\item[(v)] How different population of fast particle, generated for
  example during reconnecting processes interact with each other and
  with the background plasma?
\end{description}

The TCV tokamak in operation at the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL has 
recently received a significant upgraded with the installation of a new Neutral Beam
Injector with energy up to 30 kEV and delivered power up to 1 MW. This
new system, coupled with the forthcoming upgrade of the Electron
Cyclotron Resonant Heating system will allow to reach unexplored
scenario for this machine, with high values of normalized pressure $\beta$ and a wide range of
$T_e/T_i$ including $T_e\sim T_I\i$ and with a significant population
of fast ion. It appears clearly that the TCV machine could be the
ideal test-bed for the proposed investigation of multi-scale and
energetic particle physics, but this require an aggressive program on
experimental side and this is the subject of the present proposal. 
So far indeed the tokamak is equipped with a
Compact Neutral Particle Analyzer which can be used for the
investigation of fast particles. Actually to experimentally address
this topic new diagnostics should be installed. Among them we list the
following, together with possible collaboration international to be activated or reinforced:
\begin{description}
\item[FIDA:] \emph{Fast Ion D$_{\alpha}$ diagnostic} is based on the
  same principle of Charge eXchange Recombination Spectroscopy,
  considering the emission from $n=3$ to $n=2$ Balmer series, combined
  with a proper geometrical arrangement in order to disentangle this
  emission from other source of radiation. Presently this diagnostic
  is under consideration for a fast-track implementation of
  TCV. Possible collaboration to be activated University of
  California, Irvine and Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory
\item[FILD:] \emph{Fast Ion Loss Diagnostic} can be described as a
  mass-spectrometer for Fast Ion providing discrimination of Energy
  (through gyro-orbit evaluation) and pitch angle of the collected
  fast ions. It can also be combined with photodiods or
  photomultiplier which can give information on fast-ion fluxes at
  higher temporal resolution. Collaboration to be activated, Max
  Planck Instit{\"u}t f{\"u}r Plasmaphysik
\item[DLP:] \emph{directional langmuir probe} can be considered as an
  extension of the Mach probe for flow measurement and can be used in
  presence of population of fast ion induced by tangential beam
\item[Neutron Camera:] Neutron Camera
  \textcolor{red}{aggiungi}. Possible collaboration to be activated
  University of Uppsala
\item[Ion Energy Analyzer probe:] This type of probe is presently
  under development in the framework of a European collaboration and
  it will combined with fast magnetic measurements giving the
  possility for local investigation of the relation between magnetic
  fluctuations and fast ion fluxes
\end{description}
To complement fast ion investigation a diagnostic for the
determination of the current profile is mandatory, and in this
framework the implementation of a Motional Stark Effect or of a
\textcolor{red}{polarimeter} (?) is suggested.
The development, installation and exploitation of each of this
diagnostic can be performed in the cycle of a PhD thesis, giving the
student the possibility to gain deep insight on the experiment, and
the possibility to contribute with the data obtain in a fascinating
and cutting edge research. All the information gained by these
diagnostic can be coupled with the already existing fluctuations
diagnostic, as correlation ECE, Doppler Reflectometry and Tangential
PCI which would give the fundamental information on the typical
spatio-temporal scale of underlying turbulence. Such an ambitious
experimental program must be tightly linked to the theory department
of plasma physics of SPC. Indeed an effort is already in progress (see
for example \cite{Albergante:2011bj,Pfefferle:2014bk}) for
the investigation of the fast ion dynamics but the proposed
experimental program could provide the indispensable results to test
and validate theoretical models. On this,  development of synthetic
diagnostics for proper interpretation of experimental data is foreseen
and envisage. This could strengthen the collaboration between
experiment and theory department. 

As a final remark, to highlight the interdiscplinarity of the proposed
research line it must be noted that fast ion studies on basic
plasma devices is already ongoing in the basic plasma
department. Apart from that a program for the establishment of an
astrophysical plasma experiment is foreseen in the following year for
the SPC. In
within this program the study of energetic ion could represent a
possible branch considering that ion acceleration is almost ubiquitous in
astrophysical phenomena,  from reconnection in the planet
magnetosphere \textcolor{red}{cerca citazione} or solar flares
\textcolor{red}{cerca citazione} to the fast particle
ejection in accretion disk \textcolor{red}{cerca citazione} or
accretion flows \textcolor{red}{cerca citazione}. Thus
technology and expertise developed for the Tokamak experiment could be
transferred in the view of a cross-fertilization between different
branches of the plasma physics.

Concluding addressing the role of fast ion and its relation with
turbulence media represents a research field of frontier in the
plasma physics studies. It requires a deep knowledge of both plasma
physics and non-linear dynamics, as multi-scale processes are involved
and paradigm beyond simple diffusive processes must be considered. I'm
convinced that my previous research on non-linear dynamics and
fluctuations give me the proper background to tackle this
subject even in within the novelty of the research. I'm convinced that
the proposed plan will put the Swiss Plasma Center at the forefront in
the plasma physics research, and I'm excited to the idea of possibly
contributing to this.
