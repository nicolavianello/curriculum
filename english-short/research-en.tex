I'm interested in fluctuations and turbulence in magnetized plasma
experiments (mainly but not only fusion oriented
ones). The main research subjects are summarized as follow, with
reference to the more relevant publications: 
\begin{description}[labelindent=0.5pt, labelsep*=0.4em, leftmargin=!, itemsep=0.05ex]
\item[(a)] Electromagnetic turbulence induced transport of particle
  and energy \cite{Spolaore:2004p245, Antoni:2000p3587}
\item[(b)] Statistical analysis of plasma turbulence in the framework of multifractal analysis \cite{Antoni:2001p3221, Carbone:2002p2809, Vianello:2016bm}
\item[(c)] Investigation of non linear
  coherent structures, dubbed as \emph{blobs} or\emph{filaments}
 (drift-kinetic alfven vorticies, Edge Localized Modes, micro-tearing and current
sheets during magnetic reconnection) \cite{Vianello:2010p4670, Spolaore:2015ij, PhysRevLett.106.125002, Furno:2011cs}
\item[(d)] Sheared flow generation and turbulent generated plasma
flow \cite{Vianello:2005p1976}
\item[(e)] 3D magnetic field effect on on kinetic
properties of the plasma \cite{Vianello:2015ek}
\item[(f)] Beam plasma interaction and turbulent transport of
  energetic ions

\textbf{87 Conference proceedings} and personally presented \textbf{18 oral
contributions}. The complete list of publications is available on
request. Scientific Coordinator of different experiments
