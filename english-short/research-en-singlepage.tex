\end{cvblock}
I've been involved in fusion plasma science since my M.Sci. thesis in
Physics in 1999. Main research subjects involve,
\textbf{Electromagnetic edge turbulence induced transport,},
\textbf{Blobs and ELM filaments}, \textbf{Shear flow generation
  mechanism}, \textbf{Magnetic topology and its relation to
  transport}, \textbf{Divertor and SOL physics and   impact on pedestal transport}. Large expertise on high level
scientific objectives definition for integrated experiment, analysis
and modeling  of  Divertor,  SOL and
pedestal physics.
