my name is Nicola Vianello, I am a 44 years old Phd Physic Scientist,
currently working at the Consorzio RFX, Padova. I would like to apply for
the Task for Leader for Tokamak Exploitation within the Fusion Science
Department. 

I've been involved in Fusion plasma Science since my M.Sci. Thesis in
Physics in 1999. My primary research interests is transport phenomena in fusion
oriented plasmas with strong emphasis on non-linear dynamics. I have
addressed the problem both experimentally, through the collection, 
analysis, interpretation and modeling of experimental data, and
numerically, through the use of massive parallel fluid codes. 

I've a strong attitude in
data analysis and evaluation with a particular emphasis on the
comparison with theories and codes which provide the suitable framework for the
correct interpretation of real data. I've been involved in
the interpretation of a variety of phenomena, ranging from electrostatic
turbulence particle transport, sheared flow turbulence generation,
turbulent non-linearly generated structures, interplay between 3D
magnetic perturbation and plasma transport phenomena, relationship
between divertor conditions and upstream SOL and pedestal properties. Each of these
topics has required the development of a solid theoretical
background, and the adaptation of theories to the studied framework. I strongly believe that this
attitude provides an additional important element for the
establishment of a comprehensive integrated comprehension of
tokamak and more generally plasma physics. 

I've been acting as Scientific Coordinator of WP-MST1 experiments since
its establishment (AUG14-2.2-3, TCV15-2.2-3, TCV15-1.5-1, Topic 21 and
Topic 16) as well as in WP-JET1 Workpackage as Scientific Coordinator
of Task T18-02 and Experiment M18-41. I've deeply enjoyed the
possibility offered me by the EUROfusion framework to work on
different devices since I strongly believe that the level of
comprehension mandatory to extrapolate the behavior of future
machines overcome specific issues of singular experiment and can be
easily achieved  by the appropriate comparison of different
tokamaks. Furthermore EUROfusion offered me the possibility to enlarge
my scientific contact, and in general I believe that gathering
european expertise to work together in specific issues in a
goal-oriented approach helped Europe as a whole community to
consolidate the leadership on fusion science.

Acting as Scientific Coordinator pushed me to increase my  management and coordination capabilities in an
international environment. I've always act in order in an inclusive
manner, by proper spreading knowledge and information while keeping
the leadership in pushing forward the scientific experiment. I'm a
strong supporter of Open Science and I've acted in order to share
codes and results within the scientific team in the hope that this
could speed up the research activity.



I think that during my research carrier I have proved strong autonomy
accompanied by good capability to work in small and large groups. 

All these qualities and competences fits well with the
requirements for the position.
