my name is Nicola Vianello, I am a 44 years old Phd Physic Scientist,
currently working at the Consorzio RFX, Padova. I would like to apply for
the position of Task Force Leader for Tokamak Exploitation within the Fusion Science
Department. 

I've been involved in Fusion plasma Science since my M.Sci. Thesis in
Physics in 1999. My primary research interest is transport phenomena in fusion
oriented plasmas with strong emphasis on non-linear dynamics. I have
approached the problem both experimentally, through the collection, 
analysis, interpretation and modeling of experimental data, and
numerically, through the use of massive parallel fluid codes. 

I've a strong attitude in
data analysis and interpretation with a particular emphasis on the
comparison with theories and codes used as a suitable framework for the
correct interpretation of real data. I've been involved in
the investigation of a variety of phenomena, ranging from electrostatic
turbulence particle transport, sheared flow turbulence generation,
turbulent non-linearly generated structures, 3D
magnetic perturbation and its relation with plasma transport phenomena, ELMs, divertor
physics and the connection between divertor and upstream SOL and
pedestal properties. I've worked on a variety of different
devices with the rather unique opportunity to extend my competences
on all the major magnetic configurations, tokamaks,  stellarators and
reversed field pinches. Addressing each of theses scientific 
topics has required the development of a solid theoretical
background, and the adaptation of theories to the framework
studied. Motivated by my scientific curiosity I've established
fruitful collaborations with the plasma astrophysics community: this
experience helped me to keep a broad-minded approach for a deeper mastery of the basic 
phenomena shared by the two plasma environments as turbulence or particle energization. 
I strongly believe that my scientific carrier testifies my 
attitude towards a comprehensive integrated understanding of plasma and tokamak physics. 

I've been involved in the WP-MST1 as Scientific Coordinator since
its establishment (AUG14-2.2-3, TCV15-2.2-3, TCV15-1.5-1, Topic 21 and
Topic 16) but I have been as well an active contribution in WP-JET1, acting as Scientific Coordinator
of Task T18-02 and Experiment M18-41. The developed expertise aligns
to those required for Mission 2 of the EUROfusion Roadmap, for the
determination of a viable plasma exhaust solution, as well as
for Mission 1 given the interest on the interplay between divertor
conditions and upstream SOL and pedestal. 
I've enjoyed the
possibility offered by the EUROfusion framework to work on
different devices. I strongly believe that the level of
comprehension mandatory to extrapolate to future
machines requires an appropriate comparative approach, overcoming 
specific issues of singular experiments.
EUROfusion offered me the possibility to work within a stimulating
scientific environment. I believe that gathering
european expertise to work on specific issues in a
goal-oriented approach helped Europe as a whole community to
consolidate the leadership on fusion science.

The role of Scientific Coordinator induce me to increase my  management and coordination capabilities in an
international environment. I've always acted in an inclusive
manner, by properly spreading knowledge and information while keeping
the leadership in pushing forward the scientific objectives. I'm a
strong supporter of Open Science and I've promoted it
within the scientific team in the hope of speeding up the research activity.

The role of TFL within the Tokamak Exploitation workpackage would represent
for me a stimulating and aspiring challenge. The TE workpackage, in
particular for the Scientific program concerning the Medium Size
Tokamaks, will focus on extending even further our present understanding of
the tokamak physics providing robust scenarios in term of performance
and exhaust solution for DEMO class devices, while consolidating
the ITER physics understanding to increase the confidence for a
safe and successful operation of ITER. As aforementioned this is an
ambitious task which require a focused program while keeping an open
minded approach to extend our knowledge towards partially unknowns
territories. I think my competences fits well with the requirements
for the position and I hope I could be able to provide my personal contribution.
