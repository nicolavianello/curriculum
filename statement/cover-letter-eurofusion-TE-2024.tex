I am writing to express my keen interest in leading the Tokamak
Exploitation Task Force. Since the inception of WPTE in 2021,
my role as Deputy has allowed me to contribute significantly to the development of a robust and cohesive program. We have successfully integrated machine-specific capabilities with diverse expertise from EUROfusion beneficiaries, creating a scientific agenda that directly addresses the needs of ITER and DEMO while fostering innovative exploration.

My research focuses on transport phenomena, particularly non-linear
dynamics. Throughout my career, I have explored a spectrum of
phenomena including electrostatic turbulence, sheared flow generation,
turbulent structures, magnetic perturbations, ELMs, and the interplay
between divertor physics and upstream SOL/pedestal properties.
I've honed my skills in data analysis and theory comparison, working across various devices including tokamaks, stellarators, and reversed field pinches.  This expertise has been invaluable to WPTE, equipping me with the scientific foundation necessary to steer the Tokamak Exploitation program effectively.

Looking ahead, WPTE will face a challenging period. It must maximize the
scientific value of accumulated data, including recent DT campaigns at
JET, align with ITER's evolving research demands and foreseen
modification of the PFC material, and integrate JT60-SA into Europe's
framework. Additionally, should WPTE extend to 2027, it will be
pivotal in transitioning to a new era where new devices are expected
to become operational and private sector collaboration will reshape the fusion landscape.

I am confident that my scientific acumen, collaborative spirit, and
clarity of thought align well with the demands of the TFL role. I'm
ready to contribute to our collective goals.

Sincerely,

\makeletterclosing

% \begin{newlfm}
% my name is Nicola Vianello, I am a 40 years old Phd Physic Scientist,
% currently working at the Consorzio RFX, Padova. I would like to apply for
% the ITPA position in the Pedestal and Edge physics group. 

% I've been involved in Fusion plasma Science since my M.Sci. Thesis in
% Physics in 1999. My primary research interests is transport phenomena in fusion
% oriented plasmas with strong emphasis on non-linear dynamics. I have
% addressed the problem both experimentally, through the collection, 
% analysis, interpretation and modeling of experimental data, and
% numerically, through the use of massive parallel fluid codes. 

% I've a strong attitude in
% data analysis and evaluation with a particular emphasis on the
% comparison with theories and codes which provide the suitable framework for the
% correct interpretation of real data. I've been involved in
% the interpretation of a variety of phenomena, ranging from electrostatic
% turbulence particle transport, sheared flow turbulence generation,
% turbulent non-linearly generated structures, interplay between 3D
% magnetic perturbation and plasma transport phenomena, relationship
% between divertor conditions and upstream SOL and pedestal properties. Each of these
% topics has required the development of a solid theoretical
% background, and the adaptation of theories to the studied framework. I strongly believe that this
% attitude, which combines experimental expertise  with clear and solid
% theoretical background provide an additional important element for the
% establishment of a comprehensive integrated comprehension of
% tokamak and more generally plasma physics. I strongly believe that a
% physical properties of the pedestal and edge confined region are
% tightly linked to the SOL and boundary condition: moving from this
% assumption I'm trying to focus my experimental activities to bridge
% the gap between these two region and I believe that this expertise may
% be extremely relevant for the Pedestal and Edge physics group. 
% I've been actively involved in the coordinations of experimental
% activities in various international experiment (RFX-mod, JET, TCV and
% Asdex-Upgrade), both as task force leader and as scientific
% coordinator. I believe these experiences
% provide me a good management and coordination capabilities also in an
% international environment. My international experience is indeed very good, with vital and active
% collaborations with different European and international laboratories. 

% I think that during my research carrier I have proved strong autonomy
% accompanied by good capability to work in small and large groups. 

% All these qualities and competences fits well with the
% requirements for the position.
